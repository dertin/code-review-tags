  <h1>Privacy Policy (summary)</h1>

  <p>Last updated: August 28, 2025.</p>

  <p>
    This extension, Code Review Tags, only stores user configuration data required for its operation: custom label lists, decorations, default label, and a preference about reply field visibility.
  </p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect and store only the configuration that the user enters on the options page (for example: labels and decorations). We do not collect credentials, review content, or other personal data from the websites where the extension operates.</p>

  <h2>How we use the data</h2>
  <p>We use these settings solely to customize the extension's interface and behavior in your browser (for example, to show the labels and decorations you selected).</p>

  <h2>Who we share the data with</h2>
  <p>Configuration data is stored locally in the browser or, if the user has sync enabled, may be synchronized via the browser's sync service (e.g., Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync). The extension does not send or share this data with third parties outside the browser vendor's sync service; however, if you use browser sync that data will be handled by your browser vendor's sync servers according to their policies.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact the developer via the extension's store listing or the contact information provided in the developer dashboard.</p>
